            <p id="p1">In my time at university I have been part of a number of fun projects that have 
            developed my skills in design, implementation, testing, and team collaboration. 
            In my first semester I created a robot car move based on voice commands with an 
            Amazon Alexa and used a ultrasonic sensor to prevent head on collisions to then 
            go on and design and build an automated pinball machine. Each of these projects 
            required me and my team to collaborate, brainstorm, build, and code.</p>

            <p id="p2">In my second year of engineering I joined my schoolâ€™s brand new Vex U competitive 
                robotics team. Every year a game is made where teams are tasked to design, build, 
                and program robots to compete against other colleges. Each year provides new unique 
                challenges for students to solve within autonomous and driver controlled time periods. 
                Within a month the team president and vice president asked me if I would become the 
                programming lead for the team which has only helped build my leadership and teamwork 
                abilities. I look forward to adding on in the years to come.</p>
